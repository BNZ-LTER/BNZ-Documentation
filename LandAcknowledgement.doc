BNZ LTER Land Acknowledgement

We acknowledge the many Alaska Native Nations upon whose unceded ancestral lands our research program resides. Indigenous peoples have been in relationship for thousands of years with the boreal landscapes of Interior Alaska. Members of the Bonanza Creek Long-Term Ecological Research program strive to learn about, value, and be mindful of this relationship in our research and our actions, and to strive for collaborative, community decision making.
