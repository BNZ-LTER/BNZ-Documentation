BNZ Code of Conduct

The Bonanza Creek (BNZ) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program is committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and productive environment that fosters research, education, and community engagement. We strive to ensure all participants treat others with kindness and respect, act in a proactively inclusive manner, and take responsibility as leaders and participants. All researchers, students, employees, and visitors of the BNZ LTER program must adhere to the code of conduct described below and treat others in a professional manner. The code of conduct applies in all physical and virtual places related to BNZ LTER activities including but not limited to offices, laboratories, field sites, in-person and online meetings, and any form of writing. We are all responsible for holding our community to these standards of conduct. We rely on policies from our home institution, University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), as a guide for our code of conduct but acknowledge that other standards may apply as the BNZ LTER is composed of members across multiple institutions. If you have suggestions, questions, or need more information regarding this code of conduct, please contact Michelle Mack.
